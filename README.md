# Mapping the 2023 Turkey Earthquake

## Overview
We used ArcGIS Pro to document and analyze the effects of the **February 2023 Turkey earthquake** on population displacement and infrastructure damage.  

## Analysis Summary
- Pre- and post-earthquake population comparisons reveal significant displacement, with millions forced to leave their homes.  
- Geographic mapping shows the hardest-hit areas concentrated in Kahramanmaraş, Hatay, and Gaziantep, with widespread infrastructure collapse along fault lines.  
- The earthquake highlights the challenge of dealing with acute displacement as well as long-term regional recovery.
